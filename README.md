This GitHub repository provides the code and related materials for the cost-effectiveness part of the project "Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Automated External Defibrillators in Private Homes". The corresponding manuscript has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.   

For this research, we made use of the template developed by the Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup: <http://darthworkgroup.com>.

The notation of our code is based on the following provided framework and coding convention:
